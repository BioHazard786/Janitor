    Released by [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser).

# --- Added distribution configs for Scoop and Homebrew ---

# SCOOP BUCKET CONFIGURATION
# To use this:
# 1. Create (or pick) a bucket repo on GitHub, e.g. BioHazard786/scoop-bucket
#    A bucket is just a Git repo whose root contains one JSON per app.
# 2. Set GITHUB_TOKEN with repo write permissions when running `goreleaser release`.
# 3. First release will add janitor.json; users install via:
#      scoop bucket add biohazard786 https://github.com/BioHazard786/scoop-bucket.git
#      scoop install biohazard786/janitor
# Notes:
# - Scoop needs a single Windows archive (zip) per arch. This config already
#   produces a zip for windows via format_overrides.
# - Keep archive naming stable; default naming works here.
scoops:
  - name: janitor
    description: "Janitor organizes files into folders by extension."
    homepage: "https://github.com/BioHazard786/Janitor"
    license: "MIT" # adjust if you add a LICENSE file
    # Persist a future config directory if needed (example only)
    # persist:
    #   - "config.yml"
    repository:
      owner: BioHazard786
      name: scoop-bucket
      branch: main
    commit_msg_template: "scoop: update janitor to {{ .Tag }}"
    # Uncomment to enable automatic PRs to another fork (Pro feature requirements)
    # pull_request:
    #   enabled: false

# HOMEBREW TAP CONFIGURATION (Casks)
# GoReleaser v2 prefers casks over formulas. For pure CLI tools, formulas are
# still common; if you prefer formulas, you can manually maintain one in a tap.
# This cask will allow: `brew install --cask janitor` after user taps.
# To use this:
# 1. Create a tap repo: BioHazard786/homebrew-janitor (default Casks folder not required to specify).
# 2. Ensure an appcast is not needed (simple CLI).
# 3. Set GITHUB_TOKEN with write access.
# Users install:
#    brew tap BioHazard786/janitor
#    brew install --cask janitor
homebrew_casks:
  - name: janitor
    homepage: "https://github.com/BioHazard786/Janitor"
    description: "Janitor – tidy your folders by file type (CLI organizer)."
    license: "MIT"
    repository:
      owner: BioHazard786
      name: homebrew-tap
      branch: main
    commit_msg_template: "homebrew: update janitor to {{ .Tag }}"
    # Binary name (defaults to project name). Provided for clarity.
    binaries:
      - janitor
    # If you later add man pages, list them here (plural form):
    # manpages:
    #   - janitor.1
    # Casks generally expect an app bundle; for CLI we just ship the binary archive.
    # brew will place the binary in /usr/local/bin (on Intel) via artifact stanza Auto.
    # If codesigning/notarization happens later on macOS, configure here.

# (Optional) If you decide formulas are preferable, you can still add a deprecated
# `brews:` block, but GoReleaser signals deprecation. Prefer the cask above.
